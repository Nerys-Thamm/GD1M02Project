Nerys' Work

All of my code is commented as such in the files.

I did:
Adding Quaternions
Subtracting Quaternions
Multiplying Quaternions by a  double value
Conjugate of Quaternion

all of which can be found in CQuaternionCalc.h

I decided to use overloaded operators cause I thought it was cool,  so they arent in the form of typical methods.

I forgot to include a Readme.TXT with last weeks submission but all of my work on matrices was commented as mine within the code.
